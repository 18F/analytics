### Adding new staff to the 18F GA account

1. On a regular basis - Gray Brooks or another member of the analytics guild should go to google analytics, click on Admin, then 'User Management' for the 18F Account.  
2. New hires should be added via their GSA email addresses.  They should be given `Collaborate and Read & Analyze permissions` and the 'Notify this user by email` option should be checked.  
3. Then update [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U2rXdJXbX-wZoh8ZuEXl8VxuN-25CkIcNET2Gu880QY/edit#gid=0) to reflect that they have been given access to 18F Google Analytics.

##### For a live project that definitely should already have analytics:  

Hey,  

As part of the analytics guild's work, we've begun scanning every 18F project to ensure that it's implementing the [18F analytics standards](https://github.com/18f/analytics-standards) (correctly implementing 18F's analytics snippets and the Digital Analytics Program [DAP]).  The standards are open to updating but in the meantime, every project should implement them.  It looks like XXXXXXX hasn't done this yet.  Can you take a moment this week to [integrate these](https://github.com/18f/analytics-standards) and let us know in #g-analytics if you have any questions or need any help?  We're happy to file a pull request if you need.  

Thanks!  

Jackie, Gabriel, and Gray from the Analytics Guild




##### For a live project that has 18F GA but not DAP:   

Hey,  

As part of the analytics guild's work, we've begun scanning every 18F project to ensure that it's implementing the [18F analytics standards](https://github.com/18f/analytics-standards) (correctly implementing 18F's analytics snippets and the Digital Analytics Program [DAP]).  The standards are open to updating but in the meantime, every project should implement them.  It looks like XXXXXXX has the 18F analytics integrated properly but hasn't integrated the DAP snippet.  This is needed to participate in the government-wide analytics dashboard, an important program we support.  Can you take a moment this week to [integrate the DAP snippet](https://github.com/18f/analytics-standards#digital-analytics-program-snippet) and let us know in #g-analytics if you have any questions or need any help?  We're happy to file a pull request if you need.  

Thanks!

Hey,

The standards are open to updating but in the meantime, every project should implement them, even projects that are in the early stages.  It looks like XXXXXXX hasn't done this yet.  At some point, can you take a moment and [integrate these](https://github.com/18f/analytics-standards)?  Even though a project is still an alpha project, it's a live project so it should include the 18F analytics.  We'll want to be sure it has analytics set up in case more folks come across it and begin using it.  

Let us know in #g-analytics if you have any questions or need any help?  We're happy to file a pull request if you need.
