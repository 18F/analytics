These represent some regular tasks that can be coworking projects.

1. Add new hires to the [analytics onboarding tracking sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U2rXdJXbX-wZoh8ZuEXl8VxuN-25CkIcNET2Gu880QY/edit#gid=0).  It may help to contrast that list with the [18F Team Contact Info](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QqqS_-V44MHyVqRIyHj6Eojg1Oz5EC3fS3j1e3mDrkg/edit#gid=3).  
2. Ensure all 18F-ers have been given access [collaborate, read & access] to the 18F GA account.
