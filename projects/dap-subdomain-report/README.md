## Goals

* Assemble a relatively complete list of federal subdomains from open source information.  
* Use it to estimate the extent of Digital analytics Program (DAP) implementation and provide a list of subdomains that agencies can target for further implementation.  

## Background 

A number of my colleagues here at GSA and at DHS have done a tremendous job of [tracking implementation of HTTPS by federal agencies](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/01/04/tracking-the-us-governments-progress-on-moving-https/), per [OMB Memo 15-13](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2015/m-15-13.pdf).  As part of this work, they have assembled [a number of open source datasets](https://github.com/GSA/https/tree/master/compliance/data) that can be combined to provide a fairly complete list of subdomains across the federal government.  

While these datasets are being used to assist agencies in implementing HTTPS across their web presence, they have not yet been used to map implementation of the [Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/).  [OMB Memo 17-06](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf) now requires all Executive Branch websites to fully implement DAP on their public websites.  This project attempts to assist agencies in this effort.
