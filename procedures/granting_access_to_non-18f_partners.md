Any 18F project can choose to grant access to their project's google analytics to someone who is not a part of 18F.  In order to grant them access, we need to know what email address they want to use.  If it is not a gmail (or google apps) email address, then they need to first go to google.com/analytics and create an account there using their preferred email address.  

Then notify Gray Brooks (gray.brooks@gsa.gov or via the #analytics channel in Slack) and he can give them access.  They will receive an email notification.  

* *Note that we are not currently in a position to grant access to Digital Analytics Program data to 3rd parties.*
