Any 18F project can choose to grant access to their project's google analytics to someone who is not a part of 18F.  In order to grant them access, we need to know what email address they want to use.  If it is not a gmail (or google apps) email address, then they need to first go to google.com/analytics and create an account there using their preferred email address.  

Then notify Gray Brooks (gray.brooks@gsa.gov or via the #analytics channel in Slack) and he can give them access.  They will receive an email notification.  

It is incumbent on the project team to track when analytics access should be removed.  If a partner moves on and should no longer have access, the 18F team needs to contact Gray Brooks and specify that access should be rescinded.  

* *Note that we are not currently in a position to grant access to Digital Analytics Program data to 3rd parties.*
