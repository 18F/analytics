### Adding new staff to the 18F GA account

1. On a regular basis - Gray, Jackie, or Gabriel should go to google analytics, click on Admin, then 'User Management' for the 18F Account.  
2. New hires should be added via their GSA email addresses.  They should be given `Collaborate and Read & Analyze permissions` and the 'Notify this user by email` option should be checked.  
3. Then update [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U2rXdJXbX-wZoh8ZuEXl8VxuN-25CkIcNET2Gu880QY/edit#gid=0) to reflect that they have been given access to 18F Google Analytics.

##### For a live project that definitely should already have analytics:  

Hey,  

As part of the analytics guild's work, we've begun scanning every 18F project to ensure that it's implementing the [18F analytics standards](https://github.com/18f/analytics-standards) (correctly implementing 18F's analytics snippets and the Digital Analytics Program).  The standards are open to updating but in the meantime, every project should implement them.  It looks like XXXXXXX hasn't done this yet.  Can you take a moment this week to integrate these and let us know in #g-analytics if you have any questions or need any help?  We're happy to file a pull request if you need.  

Thanks!  

Jackie, Gabriel, and Gray from the Analytics Guild
