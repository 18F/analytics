1. On a regular basis - Gray, Jackie, or Gabriel should go to google analytics, click on Admin, then 'User Management' for the 18F Account.  
2. New hires should be added via their GSA email addresses.  They should be given `Collaborate and Read & Analyze permissions` and the 'Notify this user by email` option should be checked.  
3. Then update [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U2rXdJXbX-wZoh8ZuEXl8VxuN-25CkIcNET2Gu880QY/edit#gid=0) to reflect that they have been given access to 18F Google Analytics.
