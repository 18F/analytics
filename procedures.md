## Best Practices 
* Ensure every 18F project incorporates the team GA tag.
* Ensure that every 18F project incorporates the Digital Analytics Program GA tag.  
* Ensure that every program is registered with one or more webmaster tools (e.g. [Google's](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en), [Bing's](http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster)).  


## For each teammate 
* If you don't have a Google Analytics account, set one up.  
* Request access to the 18F GA account
